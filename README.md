## Group sort 

Sorting random data which values are continues from 0 to X (no gaps). On shuffled data, this is 15x faster than default implementation of sort.

### THIS IS NOT INPLACE SORTING
### Should be O(n) time and space. 
### Only sorted by one value  

# TODO
- Do it for multidimensional vectors
- Add more documentation
